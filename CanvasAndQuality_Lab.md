Quality Factors:

My Reason:
- Dark Souls is a tough game to play but, with it is different equipment and play styles you can use, while trying to fight that hard boss
and using different strategies to fight it making you come again and again. 

- Halo: Combat Evolved has a good narrative and combat gameplay that made me want to play again after beating it and try different ways to
clear each mission with an assortment of weapons.

- Monster Hunter: Worlds is a big game, with lots of combat gameplay, cool looking equipment, and weapons. The game has a lot of objectives
and missions that keeps the game interesting and with hardly any crashes anymore makes its more time consuming to play on.
