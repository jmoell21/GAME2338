### Rating
I rate this game 7 out of 10

## Summary
Black Desert is about, you awakening in a cave and a black spirit from the past wakes you up greeting you, beginning your
adventure.When you wake up you start off at the Western guard camp where you make you way discovering the world and its dark sercet past. 
As you explore the world you are able to do other activities such as side quest, trading, gathering, and etc.

The mechanics of the game work well whether your doing combat or your trying to level up your skills to their highest stats. While the 
game looks amazing its at a cost, with low and choppy frame rate making the game sometimes unbearable. While frame rates can be an issue 
the game lacks information on what to do or items and what they can be used for, it's like a guessing game until you figure it out.

As the game is an MMO, when it comes down to working on your skills it can be time consuming whether you grinding for resources or 
if your processing the resources, it can take a while. In the black desert you're able to hire workers, to help you obtain resouces while your 
doing quest or other things. In order to get the workers to work you need to connect nodes and make routes for your workers to go work and 
obtain certain resources in those nodes, not only that but yopu also need food or beer to replenish the works fatique after a while. The 
Black Desert doesn't explain all of this and makes the player learn how the game works themselves.

## Final Thoughts
Overall I liked the game, for the fact that there is so much to do in the game. There's never a moment where I felt there wasn't anything 
to do whether its quests, raids, guild missions, or even raising my skills up. Besides the low frame rate drops and the grinding its a good way to pass the time
and can be easily lost in.
