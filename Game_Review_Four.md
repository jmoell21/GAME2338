## Summary
Monopoly Plus is your standard monopoly bored game, in which you're competing with your friends or AIs to be the wealthiest player or making
the other players go broke. The game follows the same rules, if the dices land the same you roll again unless its rolled the same three times
you go to jail, closing down your property for mortgage money, even selling and trading property. Monopoly plus takes everything from the 
original game and makes its for players who can't play with their friends.

The mechanics are prety simple, you roll the dice and land on a property, you then dicide if you want to buy it or not, then its the next person 
turn and repeat. In the game there are spot that can either help or sabotage the player and those spots are called chance and community chest,
those spots help the player by advancing them to a certain property, giving the player some free money, or giving the player a get out of jail free
card. The other way those spot can sabotage the player is by making them pay money or sending them to jail, they're even other spot that make the
player pay money for tax that then get added to themiddle of the board for players to obtain if they land on free parking.



## Final Thoughts
The game is fun when playing with family or friends but, when it comes down to playing with AIs it can be boring and slow at times making
me lose interest in finishing the game. The game allows you to custom make the maps which sounds cool but, only with the tools they give you.
When playing the game it can be boring but, in a way it allows you to play with friends from home or across the world which helps benefit the game.
