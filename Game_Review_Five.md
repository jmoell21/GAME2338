## Final Thoughts
Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist! is a fun game to play once you get to know how to play and know the rules of the game. Its all about 
patience when playing as its all about strategy on how you play and what move your gonna make. The game is not only fun but, for anyone
who has watched or played the actual card game its nostalgic to some players, they even keep the old rules as an option to play
instead of the new ones.
