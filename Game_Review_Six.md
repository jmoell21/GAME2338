## Summary
Stranded Deep is an open world survival game, where you are in a plane until something goes wrong and the plane loses control, crashing 
in the ocean. After waking up shortly from the crash, you find yourself still in the plane that is slowly sinking as you quickly swim out, 
you then find a deployed raft and quickly get on. Once on the raft you see the ocean around you with small island popping out from the distant.

The game is a little confusing at time with the lack of information on what and how to play, like getting certain material or what equipment you
need to get that material. When playing the game it can get boring at times, as you are constantly paddling to island to island mostly looking for food
and something to help with your thirst, you can't even focus most of the time trying to find resources whe nyou close to dying anyways. The way the game 
works isn't bad it tries to make it feel real but, it feels rushed like hunger, thirst, and tiredness, just trying to maintain those meters can be a hassle.

As you play the game, when trying to get food like hunting for fishes, crabs, or even trying to salvage and loot sunken ships for resources 
comes sharks, sharks can be mainly annoying when it comes to sunken ships but, not as much when close to shore. When it comes to paddling from island to island 
there is always a shark that stay close to the playerbut, sharks aren't the only predator that can kill the player. When its in the ocean it's the
sharks territory but on certain islands its the boars and snakes that can also kill you, snakes are the most annoying thing to try and fight
as they are not only small but , also skinny that when trying to hit it with a spear or arrows your mostly likely going to miss and get poisoned.

## Final Thoughts
I like this game that it was a different type a survival game that I nevered played before it quite different since your only tranport was a
raft. The downfall that I didn't enjoy was just trying to maintain my food and thirst meters every five minutes when I was trying to explore
and gather resouces so I could progressed. Overall I'm sure after a few more update those issues could be resolve to make the game a bit more 
enjoyable and put more effort on details so the player knows what equipment they might need if they come arcoss the material.
