### Rating
I rate this game 7.5 out of 10

## Summary
Need for Speed is about you being a newcomer in Ventura Bay and trying to race with the big dogs. In order to ride with the crew you need to build
up you reputation in the city by doing races and upgrading your ride. There are five different kinds of reputation such as speed, style, crew, 
build, and outlaw, each with a different way to level up.

The driving mechanics in Need for Speed almost feel real but, off at the same time.The driving in the game varies from the player whether the
player wants their car more on the drifting or grip side, they are allowed to change it up as well as upgrading their cars performance for more 
speed and handling. Even with the performance upgrades there is also visual upgrades to make the car you want it to look like.

When palying the game in order to unlock most of the best parts for the cars you need to do the story or have your reputation to a certain level. In
order to raise your reputation you need to do each of the five such drifting for style, raising your speed and finishing a race as fast as
possible for speed, out running the cops for outlaw, driving close to other players or AIs for crew, customizing your car for build. Each race 
the player does gets harder whether the AI has a faster car or the race consist of sharp turns to mess up the player.

## Final Thoughts
What I like about Need for Speed is its visuals and sounds, the game looks and sounds amazing. After a couple of updates, the driving felt
better like i had control of the car even with the changed performances. Besides the game having bugs at launch it was the fun playing it, 
especially with friends, showing off our rides and its performances against each other. The story of Need for Speed felt rushed and out of place
with live action cutscenes, the story was boring with some humor here and there but, besides all that the game ran fine except for the 
multiplayer which would load you in and disconnect you after a few seconds of loading in.
