## Summary
Borderlands 2 starts off as four vault hunters are on a train looking for Handsome Jack the main villain of the story who sets off a trap exploding
the train leaving the vault hunters in the middle of no where, left for dead in Pandora. When a robot find the vault hunter aiding them on there mission 
and leading them to the resistance, leaving the vault hunters to help build up the resistance for the final fight with Handsome Jack. As the story 
progresses and the resistance is built up, you lead the attackto finish off Handsome Jack.

The game offers a variety of guns,grenades, and shields to help improve your hunter, as well as skills. The gun mechanics were a little hard to
get used to at first but, after a while it was easy to adjust since different guns, has different recoils. While the recoil was a lot different than
you normal shooter the game offered different benefits to the guns, grenades, and shields containing different elements.

While the game is a open world, is gives the player different locations to move and explore. When going to different locations the loading time 
can take whileto load in and can get sometimes annoying especially if its a mission that tells to leave the area go past three different locations 
for the next mission. Besides those missions the game also involves vehicles so the player isn't isnt constantly running around and has a faster
way to move around, as well as fast travel but, the load time is slightly longer than going through each location.

## Final Thoughts
Overall the game is fun to play especially when your playing with friends on it as the game gets slightly harder the more you progressed. Besides
some of the missions that make you waste time, the gun play with different weapons and grenades were fun to use and funny at times seeing your
enemy fly up in the sky. The story and the characters made the game funny and enjoyable to play with the comedy that the game displayed.
